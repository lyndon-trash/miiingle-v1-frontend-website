<h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

<p>Would you agree that many good things have already been done before? Chances are you did not create your website from
  scratch, writing every single line of code. You have probably used WordPress, Wix, Shopify, Blogger, or some other
  platform that has most of the things you need out of the box! </p>

<p>Even if you did create your website or app from ground 0, you have undoubtedly used some libraries, frameworks, or
  templates that made your life easier. Convenient, isnâ€™t it?</p>

<p>We at PolicyMaker help you do the same thing for legal documents. We continuously monitor the ever-changing landscape
  of international legislation that applies to online services and businesses. And we twist, tweak, and always improve
  our templates so that we can provide robust legal documentation for you. </p>

<p>While legal documents made by PolicyMaker will likely be the perfect choice for 95% of online businesses, it is not
  for everyone.</p>

<p>The legal documents that you will generate with PolicyMaker are made from the universal templates. Our team
  continually works on improving and revising the templates. Still, with limited resources, we can not guarantee that
  they will be 100% satisfactory for all the jurisdictions and businesses around the world.</p>
<p>
  If you have any concerns or think that the generated documents might not be the right fit for your business, we
  encourage you to consult with a professional law firm.
</p>

<p>
  Regardless, you can still use PolicyMaker as it is free and will only take a few minutes of your time. You can copy
  the generated documents and use them as a foundation for the final version of Terms and Conditions of your business.
